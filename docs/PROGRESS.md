# Progress

## 2026-11-06 — M0 discovery

Status: M0 complete; M1 not started. Environment findings and the reviewable M1 scaffold/check plan are in ENVIRONMENT.md. Foundry setup and final dependency pins remain prerequisites for the affected M1 work.

### Work performed

- Read AGENTS.md, INIT_PROMPT.md, README.md, DECISIONS.md, PRODUCT_SPEC.md, SCANNER_SPEC.md, THREAT_MODEL.md, ACCEPTANCE.md, PLAN.md, SOURCES.md and RPC_HISTORY_CHECK.md.
- Inspected existing historical probe script and raw JSON, without running a fresh probe or altering saved evidence.
- Created ENVIRONMENT.md and this log; added discovery decisions to DECISIONS.md. No application source, dependencies, credentials, Git initialization/commit or deployment.

### Commands actually run and observed results

| Commands | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Get-Location; rg --files (including targeted instruction/spec patterns) | Correct AvaGuard workspace; planning files plus existing probe/evidence |
| Get-Content on the files listed above and scripts/probe_fuji_history.py / docs/checks/fuji-history-2026-11-06.json | Scope and historical sample contents inspected |
| Get-Command for node/npm/pnpm/corepack/git/forge/cast/anvil/solc/wsl/python | Windows JS/Git/Python/WSL commands found; Solidity tools absent |
| node --version; npm --version; pnpm --version; git --version; python --version; corepack --version | v24.19.0; 11.17.0; 12.4.2; 2.51.1.windows.1; 3.12.12; 0.35.0 |
| node -p "process.platform + ' ' + process.arch" | win32 x64 |
| git status --short; git rev-parse --show-toplevel; git log -1 --format="%h %s" | Initially clean; existing AvaGuard repository; 425a624 Create init folder |
| wsl --status; wsl --list --verbose | Sandbox E_ACCESSDENIED; external read-only retry confirmed Ubuntu WSL2 |
| wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc (uname and tool loop) | Linux kernel returned; loop variable transmission failed, blank tool names discarded |
| wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lc 'command -v forge cast anvil solc node pnpm; ~/.foundry/bin/forge --version; ~/.foundry/bin/cast --version; ~/.foundry/bin/anvil --version; cat /etc/os-release' | Ubuntu 26.04 LTS; Foundry binaries absent; only Windows-mounted pnpm shim found |

Official documentation was retrieved with web search/open tools; exact URLs and observations are recorded in ENVIRONMENT.md. Direct Foundry/viem Markdown retrieval errors are disclosed there. No package registry resolution or installation ran.

Final documentation validation: `git diff --check` exited 0; `git diff --stat`, `git status --short` and a heading/status search confirmed only DECISIONS.md was modified and ENVIRONMENT.md / PROGRESS.md were added. The stat omits the two untracked new files. No application tests were claimed.

### Remaining work

Request M1 separately. Establish Foundry in WSL, record exact compatible package/compiler versions before installation, then implement and execute the proposed scaffold checks. No application tests/builds can run against the current planning-only repository. Preserve SCANNER_SPEC/ACCEPTANCE weights and golden cases. AI integration, deployment and wallet actions remain deferred.
